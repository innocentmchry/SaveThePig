# Summer Research Intern Readme

## Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati

Welcome to the repository documenting my work as a Summer Research Intern at the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati. During this internship, I had the opportunity to work on a project that involved utilizing Android Studio and various technologies to create an Affective Gaming experience on Android.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of the project was to explore the integration of emotion recognition and facial detection functionalities into an Android game. This involved the use of Android Studio's robust development environment, Canvas for graphics rendering, OpenCV for facial detection, and TensorFlow Lite for emotion recognition.

## Technologies Used

- **Android Studio:** Leveraged the powerful Android Studio IDE for Android app development.
- **OpenCV:** Integrated OpenCV to enable facial detection within the Android application.
- **TensorFlow Lite:** Incorporated TensorFlow Lite to implement emotion recognition functionality in the game.

## Project Highlights

- **Affective Gaming:** Explored the concept of Affective Gaming, where the game responds to the player's emotions and facial expressions.
- **Graphics Rendering:** Utilized Canvas to enhance the visual appeal of the game and create an engaging user experience.
- **Facial Detection:** Implemented facial detection using OpenCV to track and analyze facial features during gameplay.
- **Emotion Recognition:** Integrated TensorFlow Lite for real-time emotion recognition, allowing the game to adapt based on the player's emotional state.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the project in Android Studio.

3. Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed, including OpenCV and TensorFlow Lite.

4. Build and run the project on an Android device or emulator.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati for providing me with the opportunity to work on this exciting and challenging project. Special thanks to my mentors for their guidance and support throughout the internship.

Feel free to explore the code and documentation to gain insights into the implementation of Affective Gaming in Android!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
